1. interaction between a parent and a nested component
	a. @Input(), 
	b. @Output()
	c. EventEmitter<T>

2. component class fields
	a. state type (any change in those affects the UI)
	b. non-state type (those which does not affect the UI)

3. services and dependency injection
	reusable piece of logic (business/data access logic)
	a. create instance of the class, wherever you need to use it
	b. use angular dependency injection

4. component lifecycle and lifecycle hooks
	1. created

		a. changes => everytime gets fired when a databound property/attribute receives new value from parent
		b. init => one time event firing (OnInt => ngOnInit)
	3. updated
		changes (OnChanges => ngOnChanges)
	4. destroyed
		destroy (OnDestroy => ngOnDestroy)
