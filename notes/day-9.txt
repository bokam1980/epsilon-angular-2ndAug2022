1. routing
	how to extract route information in the component code, which is currently loaded in the outlet
	ActivatedRoute (snapshot property)=> ActivatedRouteSnapshot
	RouterState => tree of ActivatedRoute objects

	ActivatedRoute .params		ActivatedRouteSnapshot. params
	=> Observable<Params>		=> Params

2. forms:
	NG provides 2 approaches for handling user input through forms
		template-driven forms: depends on some directives (ngModel, ngForm) in the template to create and manipulate the underlying form object model
		reactive forms: provides direct and explicit access to the underlying forms object model

	a. capture user input events from the template/view
	b. validate user input
	c. create a form model and data model to update and provide a way to track changes
